# theloveapp
Tell your close and dear you love them or just need love

The idea is to easily communicate with your closest friends and family, regardless of what communication channel you use with each person.

Feel free to use the code, if you find it useful, but remember it is released under GNU GPL.

This repo is the Android app. One day there might be a server side added and apps for other platforms.
The app is based on API 15 (4.0.3). Is this good?
In the first commit the GitHib standard .gitignore file was used, later the Android Studio one. Which is best?

Spread love!
